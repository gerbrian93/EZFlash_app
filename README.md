# EZFlash_app
This application is a simple multiple choice flash style game, its function would be to help people with their mental math skills.  The adding activity is working fully, 
however since I used arrays as the data structure for the question and problems this lacks variability of problems and answer choices. Writing next activity with arraylist 
to shuffle, and a new method to populate 3 wrong answers and 1 correct answer in random positions.
